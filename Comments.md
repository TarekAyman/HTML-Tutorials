## **1. What Are Comments in HTML?**
- Comments in HTML are written inside `<!-- -->` and are ignored by browsers.
- They are used to explain the code, making it easier to understand and maintain.

## **2. Syntax of Comments**
```html
<!-- This is a comment -->
```
- Anything inside `<!-- -->` will not be displayed on the webpage.

## **3. Use Cases of Comments**
- **Code Explanation:** Helps developers understand different parts of the code.
  ```html
  <!-- This section contains the website header -->
  <header>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
  </header>
  ```
- **Temporarily Disabling Code:** Comments can be used to hide parts of the code for testing.
  ```html
  <!-- <p>This paragraph is currently disabled</p> -->
  ```
- **Adding Notes for Other Developers:** Helpful in team projects to guide contributors.
  ```html
  <!-- TODO: Add a navigation menu here -->
  ```

## **4. Best Practices for Using Comments**
- Keep comments short and relevant.
- Avoid excessive commenting on obvious code.
- Use comments to clarify complex logic or mark sections in large files.

## **5. Example of HTML with Comments**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Example Page</title>
  <!-- Metadata section -->
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Main content starts here -->
  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <p>This is an example page.</p>
  <!-- Footer section -->
  <footer>
    <p>&copy; 2025 My Website</p>
  </footer>
</body>
</html>
```
